# /r/UCSC class info bot

Looks through the [/r/UCSC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucsc) subreddit for mentions of classes and comments with information from the course catalog.

Will go on [/u/ucsc-class-info-bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucsc-class-info-bot).

### Known bugs

* Won't recognize CS as CMPS or CMPE as CMPE
* In the comment, classes are sorted by departament name.
Ideally they would be sorted by the order in which they're mentioned.
